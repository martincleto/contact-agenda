Simple contact agenda using Polymer 2

## Install the Polymer-CLI

First, make sure you have the [Polymer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polymer-cli) installed. Then run `polymer serve` to serve your application locally.

## Viewing Your Application

```
$ polymer serve
```

## Building Your Application

```
$ polymer build
```

This will create builds of your application in the `build/` directory, optimized to be served in production. You can then serve the built versions by giving `polymer serve` a folder to serve from:

```
$ polymer serve build/default
```

## Running Tests

Chrome (or Chromium for Linux OS) must be previously installed and LAUNCHPAD_CHROME env variable set addressing bin or .exe path in your system.

```
$ polymer test
```

You can also navigate to http://localhost:8081/test/follow-suggestions_test.html to run the tests.
